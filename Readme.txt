I Created this banking system project for my school work a long time ago using JAVA and MySQL(as DBMS)
In this project:

You can create a bank account
Log In to bank account
add money, transfer money, withdraw money,
pay electricity bill, recharge mobile etc...
all the data is stored in MySQL so make sure you have MySQL database management system installed and connected to your IDE
I used Netbeans IDE

Use Netbeans IDE for better view
